# Kodi Multi-Instance Dashboard (Work in Progress 🚧)

A web-based dashboard for controlling and monitoring multiple **Kodi** instances using the **JSON-RPC API**.  
This project is designed for setups where several Android TVs or Kodi clients need to be managed centrally — such as lounges, cafés, or home theaters with multiple screens.

⚠️ **Note:** This project is still under active development. Features may change, and some modules are incomplete or experimental.
